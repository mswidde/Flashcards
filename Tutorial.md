	- About the section level
		- This part is optional
		- If you leave this out, the section will appear as empty and only 2 levels of indentation should remain
	- About the quesions

	- About the answers
		- Can be multi-line, all parts of the answer should be on the same level of indentation
		- \* ○ Note that the path can be absolute or relative to the main.py program
		- \* ○ You should use a single line for the image, additional text can be added but should be on different lines
		- 
		- By default the answer is shown as a bullet list
		- \* You can use \* at the beginning of a line (after the dash+space) if you don't want to display these bullets
		- \* ○ You can still add different kinds of bullets to use your own, like is done in this line
		-  You can also simply use an additional space to indent the default bullets, like is done in this line
- Showing pictures
	- Basics about showing pictures
		- Only answers can include lines with a picture
		- It's also possible to show multiple pictures, each one must be on a different line
